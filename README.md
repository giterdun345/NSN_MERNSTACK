# Interview Project (A)
## Instructions
Build a web page that displays 15 random NSNs from the database table `nsn`. Each time the web page is loaded it should select and display a different set of 15 NSNs. Each NSN listed on the web page should be hyperlinked to another page where nsn details are displayed. At the top/header of every page include a search box. Searching for NSN "8415-00-782-2889" should take the user directly to that NSN product detail page.

- You may use any technologies and/or frameworks. - You must use the SQL database as-is without modification.
- Use AeroBase Group styling on your web pages. Ex: https://aerobasegroup.com https://aerobase.us
- Expected time to complete: 3 - 5 hours

## 1. CRITERION #1
Build a web page that displays 15 random NSNs from the database.
Expected result: When user visits {url:home}, they should see 15 hyperlinked NSNs. If user refreshes the page they should see a different set of 15 NSNs randomly selected from the database.

Products are stored in the database tables `nsn` and `nsn_flis_parts`. The {url:home} web page should list only the NSNs.

The `nsn` table contains all national stock numbers in existance. A national stock number is a formatted unique identifier which is assigned to a product with specific characteristics. Each national stock number contains a category FSC (federal supply class) code, a country code, and a unique NIIN (national item identification) code. For example NSN 8415-00-782-2889 is for a Military Jacket (seen below). There may be multiple manufacturers for this Military Jacket, however each manufacturer may use the same NSN (if the product is an exact alternate/replacement). In order to differentiate between manufacturers of this NSN, each manufacturer will issue their own part number. In the example NSN shown below the manufacturer uses the part number "MIL-L-43536". This part number is stored in the `nsn_flis_parts` table. We match manufacturer part numbers from this table with NSNs from the `nsn` table using the common NIIN column found in both tables.

## 2. CRITERION #2
 Each NSN listed on the web page should be hyperlinked to another page where nsn details are displayed.
Expected result: When user clicks on a NSN from the home page they are taken to a different page where the NSN data is displayed.

Create a new page for displaying NSN data. The URI of this page should be /nsn/{nsn}

All data for this NSN from the database tables `nsn`, `nsn_flis_parts`, and `nsn_characteristics` should be displayed on this page.

## 3. CRITERION #3 
At the top/header of every page include a search box
Expected result: Regardless of which page the user is on, they can search for NSNs using an input field placed in the header area.

Add a search input to the header of every page. When the user enters a NSN in any valid format (Ex: 8415-00-782-2889 and 8415007822889 should both be valid inputs) they should be taken directly to the NSN details page for that NSN; If there are no results the user should see an error message.

Brief Response:
In this project I used a MySQL database, an Express/Node backend and a React frontend. I was able to use an Ant-Design table to display the details from the merged data. It took almost 5 hours to get an accurate/user-friendly frontend, optimize SQL queries and to learn about the data in the database. These were the issues that took the most time in this project; I primarily use PostgreSQL and I am obsessed with optimization. Indexing was required to obtain the details from the merged data, I couldnâ€™t find any other way to speed up the query and it was challenging to not make changes accordingly to the data, especially in the NIIN field, to improve the amount of code needed to be written. There was one issue with the frontend; when I clicked the back button during the NSN detail page, after using the search bar, it would cycle through the prior urls and state but would not refresh the data on the page. It took a while to figure out that I had to force refresh the router and pop off the last element in history. Overall it was a challenging project and I enjoy anything I continue to learn with. I could have added some testing but considering the time constraints, I opted to stick with what I had.
